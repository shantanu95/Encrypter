# Encrypter
A Java desktop application developed to implement a private key encryption algorithm devised by me.

This private key encryption algorithm uses a real-valued polynomial to encrypt each character in the cipher text.
The polynomial takes five parameters to encrypt each character. Furthermore, expansions of irrational numbers (through continued fractions) have been used to induce randomness in one of the parameters.
